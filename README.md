# WCA Real Time

WCA Real Time is designed to be a one stop resource for anything required by competitors and organizers during a WCA Event. Its aim is to support functionality like live Projectors, Group assignments and easy visibility, push notifications via SMS & Telegram, incident reporting and management.

## Getting Started

If you want to test this project locally, clone the code and then run 
```
npm install
npm start
```

Note that you will need to add an additional wca-env.js with the token as 'example-application-id' and the RedirectURI as 'staging.worldcubeassociation.org' file in order for the WCA Oauth functionality to work locally with the WCA Staging server.
